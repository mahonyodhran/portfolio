        Currently, I am a member of an Agile development team, where I work with technologies such as C#, .NET, and Azure DevOps <br>
        to enhance and maintain a large reporting application in the financial sector. This experience has deepened my understanding of Agile methodology,<br>
        allowing me to apply it effectively to software development projects.<br><br>

        My skills extend beyond my current role. I have hands-on experience with JavaEE and Flask, having developed Rest APIs and leveraged third-party APIs <br>
        to enable seamless data exchange between systems. Additionally, I worked on an internal application using Python and Flask, automating manual <br>
        processes for the QA team, resulting in time savings and improved accuracy. <br><br>

        Beyond my professional work, I am a curious and proactive learner. I have undertaken personal projects involving Spring Boot and Django with a focus <br> 
        now on Go, demonstrating my commitment to staying up-to-date with emerging technologies and continuously expanding my skillset. <br><br>
