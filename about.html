        Currently, I am a member of an Agile development team, where I work with C#,<br> 
        .NET and SQL to enhance and maintain a large reporting application in the financial sector.<br><br>

        My skills extend beyond my current role. I have hands-on experience with JavaEE, having developed Rest APIs and leveraged third-party APIs <br>
        to enable seamless data exchange between systems. Additionally, I worked on an internal application using Python with Flask, automating manual <br>
        processes.<br><br>

        Beyond my professional work, I am a curious and proactive learner. I enjoy coding in my spare time and have a focus<br> 
        now on Go, demonstrating my commitment to staying up-to-date with emerging technologies and continuously expanding my skillset. <br><br>
